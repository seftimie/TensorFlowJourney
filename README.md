A list with demos, notes, extra reading, my own progress all related with [TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice). 

## Repo structure:

- [demos](demos/)  - where I'll place all the code, demos, models, notebooks etc;
- [progress/checklist.md](progress/checklist.md) - where I'll check my progress;
- [progress/timeline.md](progress/timeline.md) - where you can view my progress as a timeline;
- [notes/readme.md](notes/) - where I'll add my notes, questions etc;
- [notes/keywords.md](notes/keywords.md) - a list of keywords;
- [read](read/)  - own reading list related with TensorFlow;


## Updates: ([more details](progress/timeline.md))
- **2020-08-22**: Init 1st course: Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning;

- **2020-08-23**: Finish the first week (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo)

- **2020-08-24**: Finish the second week (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo)

- **2020-08-25**: Saw some videos on CNN (code/reading/updare repo);

- **2020-08-26**: Finished week03 and week04 (pass quizzes/codes/reading/update repo). Learned about ConvNet;

- **2020-08-27**: Init 2nd course: Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow. All first week it's over (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo);

- **2020-08-28**: Image Augmentation (my fav subject 'till the moment; such a creative way/tool for getting better results on CNN/NN using TF. Keras ImageDataGenerator class it's ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥); End week 02 (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo);

- **2020-08-29**: Transfer learning & Using dropouts! (pass quiz/reading/update repo). To undestand better this, I'll need to code some demos; It's kinda the first thing that it bothers me a little

- **2020-08-30**: End Week 03 and 04 aka Course 02; Learn about Multi-class classifier (now I know how Teachable Machine it's working at code level). Also I think that the course it's only the "basics/step by step" of all this topics. If you wanna know more, you def need more practice/code/books/run in prod. (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo);
