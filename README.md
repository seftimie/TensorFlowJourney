A list with demos, notes, extra reading, my own progress all related with [TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice). 

## Repo structure:

- [demos](demos/)  - where I'll place all the code, demos, models, notebooks etc;
- [progress/checklist.md](progress/checklist.md) - where I'll check my progress;
- [progress/timeline.md](progress/timeline.md) - where you can view my progress as a timeline;
- [notes/readme.md](notes/) - where I'll add my notes, questions etc;
- [notes/keywords.md](notes/keywords.md) - a list of keywords;
- [read](read/)  - own reading list related with TensorFlow;


## Updates: ([more details](progress/timeline.md))
- **2020-08-22**: Course 01 - Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning;

- **2020-08-23**: Course 01 - Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Finish Week 01 (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo)

- **2020-08-24**: Course 01 - Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Finish Week 02 (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo)

- **2020-08-25**: Course 01 - Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Saw some videos on CNN (code/reading/updare repo);

- **2020-08-26**: Course 01 - Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Finished Week 03 and Week 04 (pass quizzes/codes/reading/update repo). Learned about ConvNet;

- **2020-08-27**: Course 02 - Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow. Init Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow. Week 01 it's over (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo);

- **2020-08-28**: Course 02 - Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow. Image Augmentation (my fav subject 'till the moment; such a creative way/tool for getting better results on CNN/NN using TF. Keras ImageDataGenerator class it's ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥); End Week 02 (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo);

- **2020-08-29**: Course 02 - Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow. Week 02 - Transfer learning & Using dropouts! (pass quiz/reading/update repo). To undestand better this, I'll need to code some demos; It's kinda the first thing that it bothers me a little

- **2020-08-30**: Course 02 - Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow. End Week 03 and Week 04; Learn about Multi-class classifier (now I have an ideea how Teachable Machine it's working at code level). Also I think that the course it's only the "basics/step by step" of all this topics. If you wanna know more, you def need more practice/code/books/run in prod. (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo);

- **2020-08-31**: Course 03 - Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow. Init Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow. Week 01 it's over (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo);

- **2020-09-01**: Course 03 - Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow. Week 02 was about tokenized words and using Embeddings to establish meaning from them in a mathematical way! (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo)

- **2020-09-02**: Course 03 - Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow. Week 03, same basic intro to recurrent neural networks (RNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) lots of collabs but frankly I don't quite understand all this things yeat - so gotta read more about them (pass quiz/code/reading/update repo)
