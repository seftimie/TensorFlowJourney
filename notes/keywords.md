- Cell State;
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRU);
- sequence models
- sunspot activity
- dense model
- stateless vs stateful
- imputation (project back into the past to see how we got to where we are now or fill missing data)
- trend - an overall direction for data regardless of direction
- seasonality - a regular change in shape of the data
- autocorrelation - data that follows a predictable shape, even if the scale if diff
- noise - unpredictable changes in time series data;
- non-stationary time series - one that has a disruptive event breaking trend and seasonality
- naive forecasting
- fixed partitioning
- roll-forward partitioning
- training period / validation period / test period
- Univariate time series
- mse - square the errors and then calculate their mean.
- rmse - root means squared error
- mae - mean absolute error 
- mape - mean absolute percentage error (this gives an idea of the size of the errors compared to the values)
- moving average
- differencing
