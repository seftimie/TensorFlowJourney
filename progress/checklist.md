### Resources allowed

You may use whatever learning resources you would learning use during your ML development work. 

### Exam environment

You take the exam through the PyCharm IDE and a TensorFlow Exam plugin. I will look into this the closer I get to the exam. For now, time to study and prepare. 

To get familiar with PyCharm, go through the [PyCharm getting started series](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/learning-center/).
